## Minimal Weather Station


Minimal weather station based around hobby-grade sensors and the cadalogger data logging 
platform.

Rain gauge, wind vane and anemometer:

Temperature and humidity:

cadalogger:

This combination requires only trivial further components (resistors and capacitors, 
battery holder, termimal blocks) to generate a multi-parameter weather station for <Â£200 
(including cost of 
structural materials for deployment).



### to-do

- check need to disable interrupts in set-up
- make power profile for current set-up
- record V drop in hardware debounce circuits
- get photo of deployment
- photos of deployment


### Alternate power supply possibilities

Current version is meant to run off of 4.5 V of standard batteries.  This is to support a 
SH student project at a field site that currently does not have continuous local 
meterological data.  Power profile remains to be done, but MBM suspects that continuous 
operation using, for e.g., 

https://www.tindie.com/products/jaspersikken/solar-harvesting-into-lithium-ion-capacitor/

with as little as a 0.4W panel could be a future addition.

### Power consumption

- cadalogger board should sleep at about 2 uA between anemometer, rain gague and RTC 
interrupts, and when not writing to the uSD card.
- SHT31 should sleep at aboud 0.2 uA between measurements of temperature and humidity
- design has pin-ground to switch off anemometer between readings, avoiding current leak 
through resistor divider
- half of the time, the anemometer reed switch is closed, leaving current loss through the 
pullup resistor (R4), this has been minimised by using a 100k pullup, leaving 33 uA of 
current usage half the time.  This could potentially be optimised
- main current consumption probably comes from writing to the SD card every minute.  This 
could be reduced by storing data and for e.g., writing every 5 min.

### Thoughts on extensions for commercial and open-source alternate parts

This project could ultimately form the basis of a minimal design for general use 
low-investment environmental monitoring applications.  Student will ground-truth against 
nearest met site for purpose of SH project. MBM and RN and/or MJJDS to check anemometer 
pulses -> wind speed conversion (internet not consistent on info for this) against 
co-deployment with sonic anemometer upon retrieval of 
one of the latter from current St Kilda deployment.  This rain gauge is known to 
underestimate in heavy rain or high wind, but is still likely 
to generate very meaningful relative data (e.g., periods with vs without rain).



Possible future work could give options for swapping sensors for various upgrades, all 
with full open-source documentation/library/functions, and ground-truthing data, for field 
station/site-specific needs and budgets.

Options could include upgraded commercially available options or fully open-source, 
options, e.g., 3D printable items such as:

### Crude hardware debounce seems to work well as part of low-power design

Design for anemometer and rain gauge uses reed switches with hardware de-bounce (100k 
pullup with 0.1 uF to ground).  This works well for very low-power operation, and MCU seems to detect each pulse 
despite the falling edge being a bit slow (MBM to double check on scope and record result).  Testing has not 
suggested any missed pulses from slow fall time, but improved hardware debounce (e.g., add Schmitt trigger) to 
be kept in mind.  Current thinking is that software debounce would lead to more MCU awake time, but detailed 
study of trade-offs between different debounce strategies has not been conducted.
